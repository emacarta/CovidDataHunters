Covid Data Hunters is a Web App built with the intent to make usable, in an easy and clear way, all the data regarding the Covid-19 in Italy. The data come directly from the GitHub page of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers - Department of Civil Protection. The App has been developed entirely through the use of the Shiny package that allows the creation of interactive Web App directly from R.
